Simple python code =  


name = input("What is your name?: ")        
age = int(input("How old are you?: "))

print("Hello " + name)       
print("You are " + str(age) + " years old.")


This code allows you to input your name and age into the code and it then says what you just inputed. 
This code only took me a few minutes to figure out. I only incountered a few problems while making it. One of those problems only occured because I didn't 
add in "str" before the "age" variable in the second "print" line.
